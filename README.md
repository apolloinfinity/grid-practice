These are from various tutorials on CSS Grid and I will be committing the tutorial code here for my reference and for practice.

**CSS Grid** is a new and exciting feature that helps web developers have better control of their layouts.


## Grid Lines
General rule of thumb with grid lines is that if you have an x amount of columns, you will get x amout of columns + 1.
For example, if you use 8 columns, you get 9 column lines.

Same goes for rows. 8 rows has 9 row lines.
